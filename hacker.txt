5.Hacker and traffic lights
Zolo is stuck in a traffic due to dysfunctional traffic light. Zolo is a professional hacker
and he can get into the system and change the state of the light. His planet has
different types of traffic lights such that there are N bulbs on the traffic board and
only when all of them are green(G) the cars can pass. there are 2 other states also
which the bulb can show; i.e. Red(R) & Yellow(Y). Note that the lights are designed
such that they follow a state change cyclic pattern as follows:
R------>Y------>G------->R
Once Zolo gets into the system he can select any position i and update all elements
between i to min(N, i + K - 1) by increasing their state by 1.This whole process takes
1 sec and he can repeat this process any no. of times until he gets all lights = G . Find
the minimum time to do the process as Zolo is getting late for work.
